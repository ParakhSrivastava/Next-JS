# ⚡ Next.js Projects Playground

Welcome to the **Next.js Projects** repository! 🚀🧠

This space showcases a growing collection of my **Next.js** experiments, feature implementations, and UI explorations — crafted using **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript (optional)**, and modern frontend tooling.

From dynamic routing to SSR/ISR to API integrations, this repo is a reflection of my continuous learning and practical application in building production-grade, performant web apps.
